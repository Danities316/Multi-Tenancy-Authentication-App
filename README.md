# Multi-Tenancy Authentication App

Welcome to our multi-tenancy authentication app! This project aims to provide a simple yet robust authentication solution for applications requiring multi-tenancy support. Built with Node.js and React.js, it offers a seamless authentication experience for both developers and end-users.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Easily manage authentication for multiple tenants within a single application instance.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication with features like login, registration, and password reset.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and permissions to control access to different parts of your application.
- **Customizable**: Adapt the authentication flow and UI to fit your specific project requirements.
- **RESTful API**: Accessible API endpoints for integrating authentication into your backend services.
- **React Components**: Pre-built React components for faster frontend development and customization.
